# cluster-submit
Script to create executable for cluster to launch many FEA jobs. Script creates list of files with extension given by user and adds given by user command before file name.

Executable with such a structure can be generated:

submit jobdeck_1.ecd<br>
submit jobdeck_2.ecd<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
submit another_jobdeck.ecd<br>

Script can be used in case of any FEA software (for example Nastran, Ansys, LS-Dyna, Abaqus, etc) if cluster is properly configured.

File generated by script can be used to launch many jobs to the cluster at once, when generated file is executed.
